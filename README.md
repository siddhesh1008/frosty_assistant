# FROSTY – Personal AI Assistant

**FROSTY** is an open, modular AI assistant inspired by JARVIS, designed for Linux home servers with a modern web interface. It leverages the power of Cohere, OpenAI, and Local LLMs for chat, classification, and automation—ready for future expansion (voice, vision, coding, smart home, and more).

## 🧩 Main Components

- **Frontend (React):**  
  - Tech-inspired, modern UI (chat, mic, tasks, webcam, settings)
- **Backend (FastAPI, Python):**  
  - API server, manages sessions, logic, and integrations
- **Wake Word/Audio Layer:**  
  - Always-listening, wake word (e.g., Porcupine), speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), LiveKit for real-time audio
- **Brain Router & Decision Model:**  
  - Routes each user query to the correct handler using rule-based or AI-based classification (Cohere, LLM)
- **Handlers:**  
  - **General:** Small talk, facts, info  
  - **Realtime:** Web queries, news, dynamic info  
  - **Automation:** Smart home, reminders, plugins, coding, etc.
- **AI Provider Layer:**  
  - Unified access to OpenAI, Cohere, and local LLMs (configurable, auto-fallback)
- **Integrations:**  
  - Easy plugin system for external services (Home Assistant, calendar, coding, etc.)

## ⚡️ Design Principles

- **Modular:** Swap/extend any part (AI, UI, tasks, voices)
- **Future-proof:** Ready for vision, AR, coding, multi-modal extensions
- **Open:** Supports local, open-source, and cloud AI providers
- **Accessible:** Web-based, works from any device (PC, tablet, phone)
